       "['January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  1 of  28  Transcript of  Chair  Powell™s  Press Conference  January 29, 2020   CHAIR POWELL.  Good afternoon , everyone.   Thanks for being here.  At today™s  meeting, my colleagues and I decided to leave our policy rate unchanged.  As always, we base  our decisions on our  judgment of how best to achieve the goals Congress has given us :  maximum employment and price stability.  We believe monetary policy is well positioned to  serve the American people by supporting continued economic growth, a strong job market, and a  return  of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent goal.  The expansion is in its 11th year, the longest on record.  Growth in household spending  moderated toward the end of last year, but with a healthy job market, rising incomes, and upbeat  consumer confidence, the  fundamentals supporting household spending are solid.  In contrast,  business investment and exports remain weak, and manufacturing output has declined over the  past year.  Sluggish growth abroad and trade developments have been weighing on activity in  the se sectors.  However, some of the uncertainties around trade have diminished recently, and  there are some signs that global growth may be stabilizing after declining since mid -2018.  Nonetheless, uncertainties about the outlook remain, including those pose d by the new  coronavirus.  Overall, with monetary and financial conditions supportive, we expect moderate  economic growth to continue.  The unemployment rate has been near half -century lows for well more than a year, and  the pace of job gains remains solid.   Participation in the labor force by people in their prime  working years, ages 25 to 54, is at its highest level in more than a decade.  And wages have been  rising, particularly for lower -paying jobs.  People who live and work in middle -income  communities  and low -income communities tell us that many who have struggled to find work are  now finding new opportunities.  Employment gains have been broad based across all racial and  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  2 of  28  ethnic groups and all levels of education.  These developments underscore for us  the importance  of sustaining the expansion so that the strong job market reaches more of those left behind.  Inflation continues to run below our symmetric 2 percent objective.  Over the 12 months  through November, total PCE inflation was 1.5 percent, and c ore inflation, which excludes  volatile food and energy prices, was 1.6 percent.  Available data suggest similar inflation  readings for December, though we expect inflation to move closer to 2 percent over the next few  months as unusually low readings from  early 2019 drop out of the calculation.  While low and  stable inflation is certainly a good thing, inflation that runs persistently below our objective can  lead longer -term inflation expectations to drift down, pulling actual inflation even lower.  In turn , interest rates would be lower as well Šcloser to their effective lower bound.  As a result, we  would have less room to reduce interest rates to support the economy in a future downturn to the  detriment of American families and businesses.  We have seen th is dynamic play out in other  economies around the world, and we are determined to avoid it here in the United States.  In particular, we believe the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support  sustained economic growth, a strong labor market , and inflation returning to our  2 percent Šsymmetric  2 percent objective.  As long as incoming information about the economy remains  broadly consistent with this outlook, the current stance of monetary policy  likely  will  remain  appropriate.  We will be mon itoring the effects of the policy actions we took last year, along with  other information bearing on the outlook, as we assess the appropriate path of the target range for  the federal funds rate.  Of course, if developments emerge that cause a material rea ssessment of  our outlook, we would respond accordingly.  Policy is not on a preset course.  I will conclude with a brief overview of our current plans for our technical operations to  implement monetary policy.  The plan the FOMC announced back in October to  purchase  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  3 of  28  Treasury bills and conduct repo operations has proceeded smoothly and has succeeded in  providing an ample supply of reserves to the banking system and effectively controlling the  federal funds rate.  In light of the resulting stability in the fed eral funds rate and money market  conditions more generally, we decided to make a small technical upward adjustment to  administered rates to ensure that the federal funds rate trades well within the target range.  This  action reverses the small downward adj ustment made in September when money markets were  volatile.  As our bill purchases continue to build reserves toward levels that maintain ample  conditions, the role played by active repo operations will naturally recede.  Over the first half of  this year, w e intend to adjust the size and pricing of repo operations as we transition away from  their active use in supplying reserves.  This process will take place gradually , and, as indicated in  today™s  FOMC directive to the Desk , we expect to continue offering r epos at least through April  to ensure a consistently ample supply of reserves.  Based on current projections, we expect that  the underlying level of reserves will durably reach ample levels sometime in the second quarter  of this year.  As we get close to t hat point, we intend to slow the pace of purchases and transition  to a program of smaller reserve management purchases that maintains an ample level of reserves  without the active use of repos.  At that point, as in the pre -crisis period, our balance sheet  will  be expanding gradually over time, reflecting the trend growth in the demand for currency and  other Federal Reserve liabilities.  All of these technical measures are designed to support the efficient and effective  implementation of monetary policy and  are not intended to represent  a chance Ša change in the  stance of monetary policy.  We are committed to completing the transition to our longer -run  ample -reserves regime smoothly and predictably.  Of course, we will continue to closely monitor  ',\n",

Thank you,  and I ™ll be happy to take your questions.  CHRIS TOPHER  CONDON.  Thank you .  Chris Condon, Bloomberg News.  Mr.  Chairman, I would like you to comment in a little bit more depth  about one small change I™ve  noted in the statement.  It notes that policy will be appropriate to  bring Šthe  Committee  belie ves Šinflation back  to the Committee ™s 2 percent symmetric inflation objective.  That™s a  slight change from the last time , when you w ere expecting it to bring inflation outcomes back  near  the objective.  And I would put this also in the context of a comment you made at the last  press conference where you drew attention to the fact that a number of policymakers had  projected inflation overshoots two  or  three years out under appropriate mone tary policy.  Should  we take all of this together to mean simply that the Committee is more confident that a 2  percent  outcome for inflation is already baked in the cake , or that this is a signal that the Committee has  a stronger resolution to bring inflat ion  at least to the 2  percent objective and put Šbring into play  an informal makeup strategy for inflation?  CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So , in making that change, our goal was , really Šthat was , changing  ﬁnear ﬂ to ﬁreturning to ﬂŠwas to avoid possible misinterpretat ion.  So you may  remember , in the December minutes we noted that a few Committee members suggested that the  language that stated that monetary policy would support inflation  near  2 percent  could be  misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfor table with inflation running below  that level.  So we thought about that in the intermeeting period and concluded that it would be  appropriate to adjust that language to send a clearer signal that we™re not comfortable with  inflation rising persistently Šrun ning persistently below our 2  percent symmetric objective.  So,  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  5 of  28  yes, there is something in that.  It™s just that we wanted to underscore our commitment to  2 percent not being a ceiling to inflation running around Šsymmetrically around 2  percent , and  that we ™re not satisfied  with inflation running below 2  percent, particularly at a time such as now  where we™re a long way into an expansion and a long way into a period of very low  unemployment when , in theory, inflation should be moving up.  NICK TIMIRAOS.  Than k you.  Nick Timiraos of the  Wall Street Journal.   I want to ask  about the balance sheet.   How many reserves are  ﬁample ﬂ?  How many reserves does the Fed  now think it will need to conduct policy in its current framework?  And can you walk me through  how yo u and your colleagues are arriving at that answer?  CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So, thanks for that question.  Why don™t I say a few things  about repos , since I know that™ll be of interest.  So , just to bring you back , after last September™s  brief turmoil, we took prompt and decisive action , and a result Šas a result,  money markets have  been operating smoothly since then.  Just to review, those two adjustments were Treasury bill  purchases  of at least Šof  $60 billion Šsorry Šat least in to the second quarter, and  term and  overnight repo at least  through April.   And I will get to your specific question.  The purpose of the adjustments has been to assure that our policy is transmitted smoothly  to the federal funds rate, which req uires well -functioning money markets.  It doesn™t mean we™re  trying to eliminate all volatility in the repo markets.  We know that some volatility is normal and  expected in well -functioning markets.  And , as I mentioned, these adjustments have been  success ful in supplying an ample quantity of reserves.  Money markets operated smoothly,  including right through year -end , and the  fed funds  rate has remained in our target range.  So we  knowŠwe will know when these adjustments have run their  course  when reserves  are durably at  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  6 of  28  a level that enables us to control the federal funds rate using our administered rates, the interest  on reserves and reverse repo , without the need for frequent use of open market operations.  Based on current projections, we expect that the  bill purchases will durably bring the  underlying level of reserves to the ample level sometime in the second quarter of this year.  And  when we see that we™ve reached that level, we™ll begin to gradually reduce our asset purchases to  the level of the unde rlying trend growth of demand for our liabilities.  As our bill purchases bring  the underlying level of reserves up to an ample level on a sustained basis, the necessary quantity  of overnight and term repo will gradually decline.  We™ve already begun the g radual reduction in  the quantity of repo, and we™ll continue to reduce those offering amounts gradually as conditions  permit.  At some point, we™ll also raise the minimum bid rate.  Even after we reach an ample  level of reserves, it™s possible that repo op erations might play a role as a backstop and support  effective control of the federal funds rate.  And we™ll continue to discuss that issue and review  it  under  our implementation framework.  Coming to your question, in terms of the actually desired reserve  level, we know that  reserves will continue to move up and down over the course of the calendar year in a wide range  depending on volatility in nonreserve liabilities, particularly the Treasury General Account , or  TGA.  In particular, reserve levels will ne ed to be at a level high enough to remain ample even  when the TGA peaks during the April tax season.  Effectively, what that means is that we need  reserves at all times to be no lower than they were in early September Šand, I would say, around  $1½ trillion , subject to learning more.  Reserves are going to move in a broad range, as I  mentioned, and we want to be clear , that will be the bottom end of the range.  We want  $1½ trillion or thereabouts to be the bottom end of the range.  So, most of the time , reser ves will  be moving in a range substantially higher than that but not going below  $1½  trillion . ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  7 of  28  So it™s not an Šit™s not something that we™re aiming at all the time.  We know that  reserves will fluctuate and be substantially higher than that most of the  time.  We also want  interest on excess reserves and the fed funds rate to be well within the FOMC™s target range.   And we think that™ll be the case now that we made our technical adjustment.  Last points Šwe™re committed to making this adjustment process a s mooth one.  We™ll  provide more details as we go, and we expect to learn as we go , as we always have.  And we™re  prepared to adjust the details of the plan as necessary to foster efficient and effective monetary  policy implementation.  STEVE LIESMAN.  Steve  Liesman, CNBC.  Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question.   Following up on Nick™s question, I know you said it™s not QE , but it™s $390 billion over  five  months, which is a lot to expand the balance sheet.  I guess I™d ask one more time on Nick™s  question Šis there a number that you have in mind?  Secondly, a lot of people in the market are sort of concerned that it looks like QE , and  they™re trading that way.  Are you concerned that the market is embracing this like a QE  program , and that the rise in the stoc k market is linked to it , and you may then experience  something of a  ﬁtaper tantrum ﬂ the way Chairman Bernanke did when he tried to roll it off?  CHAIR POWELL.  So I™ll just ŠI™ll repeat that Šwe think that the Šwe think we need to  continue purchases until the Šuntil reserves are at a level at which they will not go below  $1½ trillion , roughly , during the course of the calendar year.  And we know that the TGA will  move up and down th ere .  So they™ll be much  higher  than that  some  of the  time , but that™s kind  of t he number , and we think we™ll reach that sometime in the second quarter.  That™s our  estimate.  But we will Šwe™ll know it when we get there.  We™ll know it because we™ll be able to  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  8 of  28  beŠto control the federal funds rate without use of Šwithout active use, ong oing use of open  market operations.  You know, our intention of these Šfor these adjustments is just to raise the level of  reserves and to allow us to conduct monetary policy in an efficient and effective manner.  And  that™s Šthat is our sole intention.  I po inted out on other occasions , more than once , the  differences Šthe really specific differences between this and the large -scale asset purchase  programs.  We™ve been over that.  In terms of what affects markets, you know, I think many things affect markets.   It™s very  hard to say with any precision at any time what is affecting markets.  What I can tell you is that  you know what our intention is.  It is to return reserves to an ample level.  We expect that to  happen during the second quarter.  And our plan as  we do that is , as those purchases get to that  level, we believe we can gradually reduce them, and we believe we can also gradually reduce  repo  asŠas we reach an ample level, as we™re satisfying demand now more from underlying  reserves from bill purchases  rather than from repo.  And , again,  the  last thing I™ll say is , we™re prepared to adjust the details of this plan as  we™ve shown ourselves willing to do depending on conditions.  JEANNA SMIALEK.  Hi, Chair Powell .  Jeanna Smialek from the  New York Times.   I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about the labor market.  We™ve recently seen wages  moderating a little bit by some measures, maybe even declining a little bit by others.  As you  mentioned , at the lower end of the sort of talent pool, it see ms like we are seeing those wages  climb up a little bit, but it doesn™t seem to be consistent across the entire sort of average.  I was  wondering if y ou™d talk a little bit about whether you guys are noticing any cracks , or whether  you™re worried about tha t, or how you™re thinking about it.  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  9 of  28  CHAIR POWELL.   The l abor market continues to Što perform well.  The labor market  continues to be strong.  We see strong job creation.  We see low unemployment.  Very  importantly, we see labor force participation continuin g to move up , really , against expectations.   If you go back a few years, you will not find a lot of forecast s suggesting that we could have  been at 63.2 percent overall labor force participation or the levels of employment to population  that we™re seeing n ow, let alone th e unemployment level.  So I think we™ve learned quite a lot of  good things about the labor market, good things suggesting that there™s been more room to run.  The performance of wages , I think , has to be seen in that context.  We saw Šif you  go  back four or five years, the four or five major wage statistics that we track were running at  around 2 percent, and now they™re running at around 3 percent, which is theoretically about  where th ey might be at full employment.  It would  consist of inflat ion plus Šplus  productivity  growth.  The Šit™s a bit surprising that , with sustained levels of historically low unemployment , we haven™t seen wages moving up above that level as we have in other long expansions and  other periods of low unemployment.  So you a sked , what can be explaining that ?  You know, one thing can be that the natural  rate of unemployment is still lower than we think, that the labor market is not as tight as it would  appear just from the 3 ½ percent number.  And the other can be , I think , that Šas I mentioned, the  sort of supply -side shock or surprise that we™re receiving from higher labor force participation.   People are coming in to the labor market and providing  more labor supply , and that is Šthat ™s a great thing.  That™s a very healthy  thing.  We™re a country that has low labo r force participation  compared  to essentially all of our advanced -economy peers , and  it™s a very good , positive thing.   Nonetheless , it represents more labor supply , and it may be holding down wages.  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  10 of  28  MICHAEL MCKEE.   Michael McKee from Bloomberg Radio and Television.  In terms  of the framework review and a little bit on Chris™s question earlier, there is a general feeling now  in the markets and among analysts that you™re basically setting us up for some form of inflat ion -target averaging where you let the inflation rate run above the 2 percent target for some time to  make up for the time that it  has  spent below that.  Is that a fair or reasonable assessment of where  you think you™re going to end up?  What would you, Ch airman Powell, think of that idea  personally ?  And, as long as I™m asking, do you have any more details on when we can expect  the results of the review?  CHAIR POWELL.  Thanks.  I™ll just say that we undertook the review because we felt , and I felt , that it  was time to incorporate the realities of what we could call the  ﬁnew normal ﬂ into  our policy framework.  And some aspects of that new normal would include ongoing powerful  global disinflationary trends, which have led to lower -than -target  infla tion  many p laces in the  world; s econdly, a flat Phillips curve , by which I mean low levels of sensitivity of inflation to  resource utilization Šfor example , low unemployment; a nd, thirdly, a much lower neutral real  interest rate here and around the world.  So those ar e challenging conditions for monetary policy  to deliver on our statutory goals of maximum employment and stable prices, although I would  say that , under our existing framework, we™ve been able to succeed or get close to succeeding it  for most of the tim e lately to achieve those goals , although we do struggle , as other central banks  do, with the inflation goal.  So this is about reviewing our strategy , tools , and communications to assure that they™re  the best that we can do to achieve those goals in this envi ronment on a sustained basis.  And we  continued our discussions at this meeting.  I™m very, very pleased  at  the process so far.  It™s  included the 14  Fed Listens  events around the country , at which we™ve engaged with a full range  ',\n",

That was a very, very positive experience, and I  think we learned a lot.  We ™ve  now had  a series of Ša number of FOMC meetings at which  we™ve reviewed what we™ve learned and also dug deeply into strategy , tools , and  communications.   I expect that we will conclude the review and announce our conclusions  around the middle of the year.  Right now, we are just at the point of coming together to put all  that together.  So I think I™m not the person who should be telling you my personal pr efere nces right  now.  I™m trying to Šand we were trying to come together as a group around  a set of answers.  I  feel very positive  about Šthat we™re going to come up with some good results, and I™m just  going to have to wait until we get to that point to ann ounce them.  DONNA BORAK.  Donna Borak with CNN.  Going back to your outlook for global  growth, we™ve seen some significant headwinds , as you mentioned earlie r, with the easing Šwith  the  partial  U.S. ŒChina trade deal , but now that there™s some new concern fo llowing the outbreak  of the coronavirus Šthat it might shake global growth.  We™re already seeing reports from Ford  and Toyota that they™re planning to shut down their assembly  plants  for an extra week.  Apple is  rerouting their supply chains.  Starbucks is  shutting down close to thousands of stores.  Are you  worried at all about what the impact would be  on the U.S.  economy , and do you see that as a  significant risk Šexcuse me Što the outlook at this point ? CHAIR POWELL.  So let me talk about  the  coronavirus s pecifically, and then I™ll turn  more to global growth more generally.  First, it™s a Šit™s a  very serious issue , and I want to start  by acknowledging the significant and considerable human suffering that the virus is already  causing.  There is likely to be  some disruption to activity in China and possibly globally based on  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  12 of  28  the spread of the virus to date and the travel restrictions and business closures that have already  been imposed.  Of course, the situation is really in its early stages , and it™s very unce rtain about how far  it will spread and what the macroeconomic effects will be in China and its immediate trading  partners and neighbors and around the world.  So , in light of that uncertainty, I™m not going to  speculate about it at this point.  I w ill  just  tell you that, of course, we are very carefully  monitoring the situation.  And , you know, as you suggested, our framework ultimately is , what are the potent ial  ramifications for the U.S.  economy and for the achievement of our dual mandate ?  More broadly,  though, if I can talk about the global economy for a second Šand if you look at the backdrop,  you know, if you go back to 2017, that was the year of synchronized growth that lasted into the  middle of 2018 , and then you saw slowing in growth , which lasted right through the end of last  year .  The fourth -quarter growth globally was quite weak last year , and a number of factors  played into that.  It wasn™t any one factor.  There was trade policy uncertainty , absolutely, but  also there was the dec ision by the Chinese authorities to try to rein in leverage and financial  excesses.  There was a turn Šdownturn in the global high -tech manufacturing cycle in global  auto production.  There were some idiosyncratic strains in some  countries like Argentina , Turkey .  And then , later , in Hong Kong and Chile , you had social unrest.  So, all of those things  were playing into that cycle of weakening growth over the cours e of 2019 and the last half  of ™18. I would say , now there are grounds for what I would call  ﬁcautious optimism ﬂ about the  outlook now for the global economy.  Many  analysts are predicting a pick up in growth this year,  although still to relatively modest growth rates .  And I would Špeople are pointing to , and we  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  13 of  28  would point to , support ive  financial co nditions, the easing of trade tensions, the lower odds of a  hard Brexit.  The high -tech manufacturing industry does appear to be rebounding well in Asia,  including in China.  The latest indicators Šmanufacturing PMIs , for example Šsuggest that  manufacturing  may have bottomed out , that they™re still below 50 in many jurisdictions , but they  have moved up off of their lows.  I would ŠI would just say , none of this is assured.  As I mentioned, we saw the fourth  quarter of last year came in quite weak Šweak er than ex pected.  We are not at all assured of a  global rebound, but there are signs and reasons to expect it.  And then comes the coronavirus , which, again, it™s too early to say what the effects will be.  Of course, we™re, as I mentioned,  monitoring it carefully.   There will clearly be implications , at least in the near term , for Chinese  output and , I would guess , for some of their  close -in neighbors , and we™ll just have to see what  the effect is globally.  BRENDAN GREELEY.  Brendan Greeley with the  Financial  Times.   As recently as  2018, interest on excess reserves was at the top of the band , sort of dragging the fed funds rate  up.  Over the course of the adjustments since last year , it™s moved steadily down , closer to the  bottom of the band.  So, if you™re mov ing it back up , how high do you want to get it?  Are we  looking to get interest on excess reserves at the top of the band again as the fed funds rate moves  to the middle of the band ?  And should we see movements in IOER as an indicator that we™re  approachi ng  ﬁample ﬂ? CHAIR POWELL.  So our stated goal is to keep IOER and the federal funds rate well  within the range.  That™s it .  Well within the range.  And that , clearly, you know Š5 basis points  from the bottom or from the top isn™t that.  So that™s why we mo ved back up.  You™re right.  Last  year we were Šwe saw some tightness as reserves were draining out of the system.  We saw  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  14 of  28  the Šgradually moving up.  And , in hindsight , we know what was happening.  With ample  reserves , we see Šwe see  that it™s possible to bri ng the interest on reserves rate up to 10 basis  points.  So now we™re Šnow we are well within the range, I would say.  BRENDAN GREELEY.   We are .  So you don™t think that , as the fed funds goes back up  towards the center of the range , that IOER is going to en d up at the top?  CHAIR POWELL.  Don™t know that.  We want  it to be well within the range.  I think  we™ll continue to adjust it to the extent it™s appropriate.  Ultimately , what we™re trying to do is  deliver a federal funds rate that™s well within the range .  IOER is just a tool to do that.  If we Šif  we need to make changes to keep it well within the range, we™ll do that .  It just means ŠI mean , the thing that matters for the economy is that we keep the federal funds rate Šwhich is the rate  that , of course , transmits into other money market rates , which ultimately transmit into all kinds  of financial conditions Šthat™s what we care about.  So, ultimately , we will Šwe will  use that  tool to keep it well within the range.  HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Thank you.  Howard Schnei der with Reuters.  Just to sort of  close the loop on one thing , where do discussions stand on  a standing repo facility?  Because  what you ™ve  said so far sort of implies that there won™t be one  or that it will be  a limit ed one.  So  if you could  just, you know,  let us know where that discussion stands.  And also Š UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER.   Can you turn mic over?  Turn  the  mic over.  HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Sorry about that.  Sorry about that .  Did you get the question?   Did you hear the question  okay ? CHAIR  POWELL.  I did.   I don™t think ŠI™m not sure your colleagues did.   [Laughter]  HOWARD SCHNEIDER.  Where  do the discussion s stand on standing repo ?  [Aside]   That was great.  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  15 of  28  And the other thing is , on the,  you know , on the standing repo facility and on the  purchases ŠTreasury bill purchases , as you enter this new regime later in the second quarter or  later in the year , will that be preannounced by amounts?  Will the re be preset amounts like  you™re doing now , or will that just be something that people will have  to sort of intuit and figure  out as you go along?  CHAIR POWELL.  So I™ll go in reverse order.  When we Šwhen we  make decisions  about the steps we™re going to be taking in that adjustment process that I described at some  length, we™ll be making them as earl y as we can and as transparently as we can Šand  specifically.  But we™re not at that stage.  It™s January , and we™re several months away from Šfrom  that.  In terms of the standing repo facility, as I mentioned  in, I guess , in my answer to an  earlier question,  there may well be a role for repo in this system even after we™re at an ample -reserves level.  Now, we haven™t decided what that role is, we have not decided Šwe haven™t at  all made a decision on  a standing repo facility .  W e haven™t.  We ™ve  had a couple o f discussions  about it , as you know , back in , I guess , June and October.  And there™s a range of views .  We™re  going to return, I would say, fairly soon to this question . And I think it was wise to wait , because we™re still getting a better sense of what that Šwhat that  world looks like.  And, you know, it™s really going to be a question of , how useful will  it be?  What will be the costs and benefits?  And my thinking is , we will return to that fairly  soon , and I wouldn™t assume a decision one way or the other .  R eally , we haven™t made one , because we haven™t had to .  And I think you Šwhen you delay, you get more information by  waiting.  It™s good to wait.  We don™t have any urgency in making that decision , because we™re  still trying to find that sort of stable equilibrium where we™re in an ample -reserves regime.  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  16 of  28  HEATHER LONG.  Heather Long from the  Washington Post.   I™m wondering, do you  think that there is a financial stability risk from climate change?  Yo u™ve spoken several times  that you think severe weather events are happening more often and that the Fed is monitoring  what that could physically do to a bank or a financial institution, but that ™s sort of one institution.   Do you think there™s a systemwid e risk that may Šthat could develop from climate change?  CHAIR POWELL.  So that™s an interesting question Šthe  question being , is there a  systemwide financial stability risk?  I™d say , over Šover  the longer term , it™s certainly possible , and I would say that sort of feeds into the way we™re thinking about climate change as an  institution.  So, as I™ve mentioned, climate change is an important issue, a very important issue , but it™s essentially assigned to many other agencies in the federa l government and state  governments for leadership on that.  And , importantly , society™s overall response to climate  change needs to be decided by elected officials and not by the Fed.  All of that said, if you look at our mandate, we™ve got a monetary polic y mandate and,  more immediately perhaps, a supervisory mandate where we™re supervising financial markets , utilities , and financial institutions , banks .  And we haven™t Šwe share overall responsibility for  financial stability with a number of agencies.  And  that latter part ŠI think the public has every  right to expect and will expect that we will assure that the financial system is resilient and robust  against the risks from climate change.  Now, I think that™s got to be right .  We are in the very early stages , as are other central  banks , in understanding just what that means.  And there™s quite a lot of work going on around  the world at other central banks and  at  the Fed, too, to think that through.  But I do think it™s Šin  that sense , it has to be part of our  role , andŠbut not the overall response of society to climate  change.  That™s not us.  ',\n",

So we™ve attended all of their meetings and taken part in them , and  we™ve been looking at joining in one form or another and talking to them about that .  W e probably will do that at some point.

Edward Lawrence from Fox  Business Network.  So there was a signing of a ratified USMCA at the White House today .  Mid-February , the phase -one China dea l gets Šgoes into effect.  Have you seen business investment  pick up at all?   If not, what will it take to get that business investment going as this uncertainty  isŠis being cleared up?  CHAIR POWELL.  Ye s.  So I guess I™d start by saying that the fact that  we™ve reached  a phase -one deal with China and the fact that we™ve moved ahead closer to getting USM [C]A agreed Šthose are potentially positive things for the economy without question .  Without  question.  And financial markets Šthe reaction of financial marke ts is very consistent with that  perception.  A sustained reduction in uncertainty over time should improve business sentiment , investment, which would provide some additional support for the economy.  It™s important, though, to bear in mind a couple of thin gs.  First, trade policy uncertainty  remains elevated.  Businesses continue to identify it as an ongoing risk.  We still have two or  even three active trade discussions that are going on in the public square right now.  So it hasn™t  gone away , and we™ve ju st come through a round of talking to our vast network of comments Šsorry, contacts in the business world.  And I think , clearly , these are seen as positive  developments going forward, but there™s a bit of a wait -and -see attitude Šis this going to be  ',\n",

So, I  would say, we need to be a little bit patient about the effect on the economy.  There™s also the global economy.  You could Šyou could well see manufacturing Šas I  mentioned, manufacturing PMIs have started to tick up consistently among both advanced  economies and emerging market economies.  We do not see a decisive recovery, but it™s possible  that this mix of positive developments and also accommodative financial co nditions could spur  further growth.  MICHAEL DERBY.  Hi, Mike Derby with  Dow Jones .  Do you have any greater sense  of what Šwhat  was going wrong with the repo market starting in September?  There seem ed to  be, you know Šwhether it was a one -off event, you kno w, too tight around tax payments and  debt settlement , or whether there™s a more enduring issue going on with the market, more  structural forces that are basically gumming up the repo sector . CHAIR POWELL.  Yes.  As for those forces, so , as we indicated , we would undertake a,  you know, serious review of that question and look at both  our  regulations and also supervisory  practices .  And we™d be prepared to adjust those in ways that might encourage liquidity to flow  more easily in the system as long as it didn ™t undermine safety and soundness.  And so we™ve  undertaken that , and w e™ve done a ton of work , actually .  We don™t have anything to announce  here today , but I feel good about the Šwhat we™ve learned there.  I think Šyou mentioned other  factors .  We will be  announcing our findings.  I™m not going to give you a time, but we™re Šwe™re  well along in that assessment at this time.  I think we also found out, though, that the level of reserves that we need in the system to  conduct our operations without frequent reso rt to open market operations was higher than we  had  thought and was higher than others  had  thought, too.  We learned that we can™t let reserves Šwe  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  19 of  28  shouldn™t let reserves go below  $1½ trillion Šroughly, the level of early September Šat any  point.  And that me ans that reserves will move  through in  a range over the course of the year that  will be substantially higher than  $1½ [trillion] , but they won™t ever go below.  So  $1½ [trillion]  is not a target level .  It is the bottom of a range in which reserves will be  expected to move.  CHRISTOPHER RUGABER.  Hi, Mr. Chairman .  I just wanted to ask about how your  balance sheet operations and repo Štemporary repos Šhow they affect the system and who  they™re helping .  Clearly, they™re mostly designed, as you said, to get Škee p the fed funds rate in  the range you™re looking for.  But , certainly, the repo market is also used heavily by hedge funds  and other Wall Street institutions .  And so , how would you explain to, sort of,  Main Street  why  you™re doing all this for that market?  And how would you address criticism that it is helping  mostly Wall Street , along with everything else?   Thank you.  CHAIR POWELL.  Well, let me just stress that we have a very specific and important  reason for ca ring about money market operations generally , and that just is that we are Šour  monetary policy decisions are transmitted through the financial markets Šthrough the money  markets into other financial markets and into broader financial conditions.  So we care  that  money markets are operating smoothly .  And they stopped operating smoothly, briefly, back in  September.  And so we acted.  This is a one -time thing that we™re doing to adjust the level of  reserves so that the money markets will be able to operate smo othly on an ongoing basis.  Repo markets are important , because that™s where Treasury securities Šthe purchase of  Treasury securities, which is the way Šyou know,  the federal Špart  of the way the federal  government is funding its operations.  It™s the way thos e are financed.  So these are largely  Treasury securities that have been purchased by dealers  toŠfor distribution to Šand buyers , to a  substantial extent .  That™s what™s going on in the Treasury repo market.  So it™s just the financing  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  20 of  28  for Šfor that.  Now, a gain, we don™t Šthat activity is a Šis a  market activity.  We™re not looking  to eliminate volatility or protect anybody from volatility at all.  What we care about is that  volatility in the repo market can affect the transmission of Šof our policy decisions t o federal  funds rate , and that really is important for the public.  NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Nancy Marshall -Genzer with Marketplace.  Chair  Powell, is the Fed going to vote tomorrow on changes to the Volcker rule restrictions on banks  investing in venture ca pital funds?  What can you tell us about what the Fed is considering?  And  why make those changes?  CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So we will be looking tomorrow and voting on a Ša new part  ofŠpart of  the existing Volcker rule , and that is the covered fund provisions  of the rule .  And we™ ll be  making a bunch of proposed revisions that we believe are faithful to both the letter and  the spirit of the law.  We™re going to put those proposals out for public discussion , and we™re  going to listen carefully, as we always do,  to public comments on those proposals.  Again, we  believe that they will be Šand you™ll see them tomorrow Šwill  be public Šyou know, will be  publicly Šwe have a Board meeting tomorrow to do that.  NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  Now , is this just the venture capital f unds, or  are  also  you changing the rules for hedge funds and private equity fund s? CHAIR POWELL.  It™s covered funds.  It™s Šso it™s th at covered Šso it™s not the  proprietary trading part of Volcker .  It ™s the covered funds part.  NANCY MARSHALL -GENZER.  And  is there a chance that banks could take this and  run and maybe even get involved in mortgage -backed securities again and risky investments?  CHAIR POWELL.  You know, we™ll Šwe think that what we™re doing is Šis very  consistent with safety and soundness and ab solutely consistent with the letter and spirit of the  ',\n",

We™ll be Šwe™ll be  getting comments from people, and we™ll be looking into that  question , among many others.  GREG ROBB.  Thank you.  Thank you , Chairman Powell.  I™d like to turn your atte ntion  back to China and the health of its financial sector in particular.  And I guess I™m basing my  question on reading the transcripts from 2014 that came out earlier this month.  Just Šin March  of that year, there was concern about the Chinese economy, a nd one of your colleagues on the  FOMC at that time asked the staff about how the Chinese economy would hurt Šhit the U.S.  economy.  And the staffer said that there was a Šwhat they were worried about was that not only  was the Chinese economy slowing down, bu t there was the financial sector .  And the quote was :  ﬁThere™s a tremendous amount of dodgy loans in China.ﬂ  Now, I was wondering if you could  give us an update on these problems in the Chinese financial sector .  And how do you think it  might impact the  economy , particularly now that they™ve been hit by this unexpected shock?  CHAIR POWELL.  Well, China has had a problem for some years, including from that  period Š2014 up until, I guess, ™17 or ™18 , and I thought Šwhich was essentially just a lot of debt  for  an emerging market .  For an economy  at the Šat th e stage  of evolution of the Chinese  economy, they had very high levels of debt Šnot sovereign debt the way we think of it , but more  business debt Šdebt  of  state -owned enterprises and also just private business es. And a couple of years ago the authorities decided to try to get that under control Što stop  the growth and to control it.  And that Šas I mentioned, that™s one of the reasons why Chinese  growth slowed, and it™s one of the reasons why global growth slowed , because we felt that.  And  they™ve actually stuck to that even during this difficult period when they were experiencing, you  know, strains from trade negotiations and that kind of thing.  The authorities have stuck to that  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  22 of  28  and have, again, continued to t ry to do that , soŠto try to control the growth of debt .  And that™s  important that they do that.  We don™t think that Šthat  there™s any imminent risk there , although you Šas you point  out, the coronavirus thing is a significant thing, which will Šwill  have some effects on the  Chinese economy, at least in the short term.   The  Chinese economy is very important in the  global economy now.  And, you know, we Šwhen China™s economy slows down, we do feel  that Šnot as much as countries , though , that are near Chi na or th at trade more actively with  China, like some of the Western European countries.  We still have Šyou know, 85 percent of  our economy is domestic.  And we have a much smaller external sector, trade sector, than other  economies just because of our phys ical location.  BRIAN CHEUNG.  Hi .  Brian Cheung here, Yahoo Fi nance.  So the combination of  T-bill purchases and repo operations  have  been described colloquially as  ﬁliquidity .ﬂ  I™m just  wondering if you semantically agree with that description Šthen , secondly, what the impact of  that has been on risk assets.  I don™t know if that™s something that , you know , the Board or  Reserve Banks are formally looking into or just looking at what the effect of it has been .  How  are  you kind of think ing  about that going  forward?  Thanks.  CHAIR POWELL.  Well, so , two questions.  I mean, in terms of liquidity, I think what  we™re doing is what I said :  We™re trying to raise the level of reserves back up to a level so that  banks can meet their reserve requirements , and that t here™s enough reserves in the system that we  don™t see reserve scarcity , and we don™t have to use repo operations to provide additional  reserves .  So I think , as I mentioned, we believe we can get to that state at the current pace  sometime in the second qu arter.  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  23 of  28  In terms of effects on risk assets, as I said earlier, it™s very hard to say what is affecting  financial markets with any precision or confidence at a given time.  It™s not our intention to  change the stance of monetary policy.  These were designed  to provide more reserves and , really , to do that in order to enable better transmission of our Šof our  rate decisions into the economy  under our chosen framework.  That™s really the purpose of what we™re doing.  JEAN YUNG.  Hi .  Jean Yung with MNI.  I wanted  to ask about the framework review  again.  Would a shift of focus to inflation over an average period Šwould that call for a different  policy stance if you made that shift?  And whether or not we know the answer to that question,  would the Fed consider chan ging the stance of monetary policy for that reason even if there was  no change to the economic outlook?  CHAIR POWELL.  Well, as you know, we™re comfortable with our current policy stance.   We think it™s appropriate .  We think it™ll remain appropriate as  long as data coming in are  broadly in keeping with our outlook.  Over time Šover time , though Šlet me take a step back.   Over time, an average inflation -targeting framework would be different than our current  framework , in the sense that it wouldn™t be  aŠthe re would be some aspect of trying to make  inflation average 2  percent over time, which means , if it runs below 2 percent for a time , it has to  run above to bring the average  up.  So that is a different framework.  Our current framework is one where we say Šor we™d  be equally concern ed with  deviations of inflation from target on either side.  But that isn™t Šthat doesn™t suggest an  intention specifically to have those deviations be symmetric.  In other words, that would Šconsistent with  that would be having all  the deviations be on one side, which is what we™ ve had , actually.  So I think it is a change in framework, and over time it would lead to a different  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  24 of  28  approach to policy.  Again, I™m not trying to ŠI don™t want to comment on the current stance of  policy, whi ch we do think is appropriate.  DON LEE.  Don Lee with the  L.A. Times.   I wanted to ask you about the stock market.   By historical comparison s, as you know, valuations are  considerably  high.  And I just wonder  how much discussion and concern you and your co lleagues have about that and what risk s you see for the economy . CHAIR POWELL.   So we Šwe look at  a very broad range of financial conditions  where Šthere isn™t any  one financial condition that we Šthat we  look at.  And when we look at  financial conditions, wh at matters for the real economy is substantial changes in Šor, material  changes in financial conditions that are sustained over a period of time.  If I can, maybe I™ll Šmaybe I™ll  answer that in the context of our overall financial  stability framework.  That™ s one way to look at it.  So we look at Šwhen we look at financial  stability, we look a tŠreally, we™ve got four pillars to that , the first of which is leverage in the  financial system that is at a comfortable level.  Our banks, particular ly our  large  banks,  have high  levels of capital.  The second is leverage in the nonfinancial sector, and that divides into households and  businesses.  Households™ debt to GDP is Šhas been coming down since the financial crisis.  It™s  not moving up.  It™s at low Šlow  levels compared to what it was before the crisis.  So not every  household Šbut, in the aggregate , household debt is in a good place, a very good place.  Business  debt has been moving up.  We™ve been calling that out for more than a year Šsubstantially more  than a year, and it™s something we™re focused on .  And we™ve taken appropriate measures and  are  monitoring carefully.  But we think it™s not something that would threaten financial stability , but  more be an amplifier.  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  25 of  28  The other one is asset purchases , gett ing to your Šsorry, asset prices , getting to your  question.  We do see asset valuations as being somewhat elevated ŠI do Šsomewhat elevated .  If you look at risk spreads, they™re narrow .  If you look at P /Es, they™re high.  I think the way to  think about Ša go od way Šone way to think about equity prices , though, is , what™s the premium  you™re getting paid to own equities rather than risk -free debt ?  And that™s also at fairly low  levels , but not extremely low levels.  So valuations are high , but not at extremes.  The final factor is funding risk .  Are  big financial institutions and other players in the  financial system funded with stable funding , or is there a lot of run risk?  And the answer is , very  stable funding, for the most part.  So if you look at , overall Šwhat you see , in my view , is, vulnerabilities to the financial Što financial stability are moderate overall.  KATY O™DONNELL.  Hi .  Katy O™Donnell, Politico.  I wanted to know, do you support  Governor Brainard™s vision for the Community Reinvestment Act reform ?  And is this  something that we could see the Fed formally propose at some point?  CHAIR POWELL.  So let me say that I think this is a good time to do Što update CRA,  really, in a way that is a win Œwin both for the intended beneficiaries Šlow - and moderate -income communities Šand also for banks that would like to have more certainty about Šabout  what does and doesn™t qualify and that sort of thing.   The law can both be more effective and  more efficient is Šit comes down to.  A nd we think this is a good way.  It™ s also just a good time  to take on board the way the delivery of banking services has changed through technology and  demographic change as well.  We worked very hard to try to get on the same page with the other two agencies.  We  think that an interagency f inal rule together would be the best outcome.  We™re sorry we haven™t  been  able to get there , and we still hold out some hope that we will be able to.  We spent a lot of  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  26 of  28  time on research and analysis and looking at meaningful reform.  You saw Governor  Brainard™s  recent speech presenting some of the thinking and the analysis.  And we haven™t made a ny decisions about what we™re going to do, about whether we™ll propose ŠI mean, our focus has  been entirely on trying to get to agreement with the OCC, really.   So  we  haven™t made any  decisions about what we™re going to do going forward.  In terms of, you know ŠGovernor Brainard led our oversight committee over these  activities for many years, and I asked her to take the lead on CRA modernization, which is a high  priority for us.  I was comfortable with her speech, and I™m comfortable with the work we™ve  done and with the Fed™s position on this.  As I said, we haven™t chosen to bring a proposal  forward.  We haven™t decided what to do, whether Šgoing forward.  And we™ re not going to  comment on the other proposal.  It™s just not appropriate to do.  It™s not about us.  It™s not about  our views.  It™s about the views of the interested parties.  HANNAH LANG.  Hannah Lang with  American Banker.   Thank you for being here  today .  I wanted to ask about Vice Chair Quarles™s recent speech on bank supervision in which  he laid out some suggestions for making changes to the supervisory regime.  I wanted to ask, do  you agree with his approach ?  And are there any plans to codify some of  these suggestions later  in the year?  CHAIR POWELL.  So I do agree that Šthe principles that he articulated  of  firm and fair  supervision and effective transparency in communications.  I also think it™s a good thing that we  would have brighter lines to defin e our  LISCC supervisory  portfolio, which we haven™t really  had to date.  Remember that when a firm moves from one portfolio to another, that doesn™t mean  that its level of scrutiny or supervision will change.  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  27 of  28  SoŠand I also thought that, you know, the Šhe™s  raising some very interesting questions  about , if you Šin the first part of the speech, where he™s talking about regulation and supervision  and , you know, how to Šhow to  balance the desire for transparency and due process  in everything  the  government does wi th the needs of confidential supervision.  It™s a very  challenging question.  It™s one that could use further thought.  And as far as the specific, you  know, proposals, there™s Šyou know, they™re interesting, you know, a nd need  further  development and  will  need lots of comment and that sort of thing.  MARK HAMRICK.  Thank you.  Here we go.  Sorry , I had it  [the microphone]  upside  down.  That™s not too good.  Mr. Chairman, Mark Hamrick with Bankrate .  Thank you.  I want ed to ask you a question  about the Šone of  the unintended consequences  over  the years -long low interest rate  environment , and that is that savers haven™t gotten as much return as would have otherwise been  the case.  What would you say to those individuals who™ve seen the Fed again cutting rates,  eroding their ability to get a higher return on their savings?  And how much would you take their  plight into consideration?  How much can you sympathize with them?  CHAIR POWELL.  Sure.  So we Šwe are assigned a job by Congress, and that is to use  our tools t o pursue maximum employment and stable prices.  And that™s what Šthat™s our focus.   Now, monetary policy is a blunt instrument, but it™s a powerful one.  So I think if you look Šlook at the time since the financial crisis .  That was Šin  the week  [wake]  of fairly modest  growth, it was a powerful recovery in the labor market.  And part of that just is the effect of  lower interest rates.  So, if Šso many, many people benefit from low interest rates.  In fact, you  don™t hear Šwhen you talk to the low - and modera te-income communities, one thing you don™t  ',\n",
       " 'January 29, 2020    Chair Powell™s Press Conference   FINAL  Page  28 of  28  hear is , ﬁYou ought to raise rates. ﬂ  That™s not what you hear.  You hear quite the opposite,  which is, you know,  ﬁPlease do whatever you can to keep this expansion going. ﬂ I absolutely sympathize with people.  If  you™re living on just the interest in a bank or on  fixed -income generally, then that™s a challenging thing.  On the other hand, if you own a home,  home values Šthe housing market has recovered, other financial assets have recovered, so Šbut, yes, for some p eople who are limited to those sources plus whatever other help they get, it can be  challenging.  I mean, we have to do what™s best for the Šfor the  overall society and the economy.   That™s Šthose are our orders from Congress.  Thanks very much.  ']"
